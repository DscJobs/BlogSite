# Introduction

Hello everyone. I first of all want to say welcome to our New Official Blog Site
From now on this is where we will post most of our updates and things that our
members need to know.

This site is still a huge work in progress but it will be updated frequently
with more features including authorization and much more.

## DscJobs Plans
As most of you know we have been talking about doing a rewrite of the current
DscJobs website for a while now and other then that we have failed to give any
sort of updates or planned release dates so i wanted to clear that up in this post.

I am actively working on the next version of DscJobs but as we all know updating
and rewriting a website and discord client from scratch takes time, dedication and patience

However the rewrite is coming along well and I should be able to announce an official release
date within the next couple weeks. Please see below for a list of our planned changes and what
frameworks were planning to use for this update ❤️

## Planned Changes - Current

Currently I am aware and understand that there is a variety of ongoing issues and bugs within
the DscJobs Website and i will do what i can to address and fix them so long as they are properly
reported:

- Update Website Navbar
- Update Buggy Navbar Selection
- Fix Issues causing users to Adjust Page Zoom

## Planed Changes - New

- Complete Website Rewrite
- Improved User Profiles
- Improved Curriculum Vitae
- Ability to link and display Guild Info in your Curriculum Vitae
- Improved Staff/Admin Panel
- Improved Backend Code
- Improved Frontend Code

This post will be updated frequently with more changes but that's all
i can think of for the time being.

## Framework/Stack Plans

Currently for the Rewrite our Stack List looks like this:

This will also be updated frequently as we add and use more frameworks.
