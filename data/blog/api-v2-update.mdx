# Introduction
Well hello everyone, I figured it was about time for an update
regarding the DscJobs API and it's current and planned features.

---

## Quick Summary
As most of you know since the release of our API it has lacked
a variety of useful features and endpoints that can be used and
interacted with by our community developers and their packages

I am constantly looking for and thinking about ways that I can
provide you all with a better, more useful, reliable API aswell
as planning for the next major version.
