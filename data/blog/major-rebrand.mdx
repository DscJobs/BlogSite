# Introduction
Hello everyone. Just wanted to stop by and give everyone a quick update regarding the future of our website and servers.
We the owners of DscJobs have thought long and hard about rebranding our services to better represent what we do as a whole!

---

## Planned Changes
We will be taking the next week or two to update our website and services to respect our new name and domain. We will work to
push and release these updates as soon as we possibly can however this is not a change that can easily be accomplished in less
then a few days atleast! 

DscJobs will be branded under the **"JobCord"** name and **"jobcord.co"** domain these changes as stated above will take affect as soon
as possible and should have no major effect on our users and how our services are provided to them. The **"dscjobs.org"** domain will remain
active until it next expires and will serve as a redirect to our new domain.

### What has already changed?
Honestly nothing major has changed as of yet. We have however moved our Twitter Branding to the new name. This Twitter page is available [here](https://twitter.com/jobcord)
