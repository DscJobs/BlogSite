# Introduction
Hello everyone, I am sure you have all noticed the change to our logo on a variety of platforms and are wondering why
we haven't posted any response into this years Pride Month. Quite frankly we have been busy and wanted to wait until we
had a plan to go with our words. So let me give you the 411 on what we're doing this time around and some answers to whatever
other questions i feel you may have.

## Why do we support LGBT+ Community's? 
Here at DscJobs we believe in equality and fair rights for all. Both inside and outside of the services we have made that you all know and love
we believe for and strive in encluding everyone and making them feel safe and welcome wherever they go whether it be on discord, twitter or in a real
world scenario. We want both our members and staff to feel like they don't have to be ashamed of who they are or that they may be judged for their actions. We are all our own
person, we can all make our own choices and stand and fight for what we want and love. Nobody is perfect and to be honest with you this world would
be nothing if everybody was.

## What we are doing to give back!
During the month of june any and all revenue made via ad services, Premium payments, donations or anything of the sort will be sent to a variety of
charity's and organizations that work with and provide support for members of the LGBT+ community. 2022 So far has been a roller coaster of emotions
and if there is anything that I think we the people can learn from it is that we are all stronger together. Regardless of your race, religion or sexual
orientation. All money raised for these charity's I will personally double. DscJobs believes in everything that betters our society and benefits us all as human beings
we do not make contributions like this just for any old special event. Honestly we are contributing on a year round basis.
